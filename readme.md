# PersonalPage
A small project with the code for my personal page. Will be updated as I advance my skills and progress in my career. All constructive feedback is welcomed and encouraged!

To execute this project all you need is an internet browser, and to edit or complement the code you only need a text editor or IDE of your choice.
I used and recommend Visual Studio Code, you can download it for free at https://code.visualstudio.com/
